## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ raw/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sp500_earnings_yield.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ us10y_yield.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ charts.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ data.ipynb
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

- `raw/`: Contains the raw data files.
- `charts.ipynb`: Notebook for generating charts.
- `data.ipynb`: Notebook for data collection and cleaning.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies.

After running the notebooks for the first time, you will also have the following directories:

- `chart/`: Stores the output charts. Generated by the [`charts.ipynb`](charts.ipynb) notebook.
- `clean/`: Contains cleaned data files, ready for analysis. Generated by the [`data.ipynb`](data.ipynb) notebook.

## To-Do

1. Abstract the data source name and URL into the CSV
2. Create GitHub repository
3. Commit code
4. Add license

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Choose the appropriate Python environment for the project.

   ```sh
   pyenv local 3.11.9
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pipenv install
   ```

## Execution Instructions

### Data Collection and Cleaning

1. Run the `data.ipynb` notebook.
   - This notebook will process the raw data located in the `raw/` directory.
   - The cleaned data will be saved in the `clean/` directory.

### Chart Generation

1. Run the `charts.ipynb` notebook.
   - This notebook will read the cleaned data from the `clean/` directory.
   - It will generate charts based on the processed data and save them in the `chart/` directory.

## Output

- The output charts will be stored in the `chart/` directory. For example, `earnings_yield_cycle_plot.png` is a chart generated by the `charts.ipynb` notebook.
